# Early-detection-of-Disasters-using-Bird-Chirping
This study explores the potential of using bird chirping patterns as a novel method for predicting natural disasters. Birds are sensitive to environmental changes, and their vocalizations can change in response to impending disasters such as storms, earthquakes, or other disruptions. By employing advanced deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), the study analyzes these audio signals for irregular patterns indicative of environmental disturbances. The system integrates a real-time alert mechanism, which notifies users through audible alarms and email alerts when disaster-related anomalies are detected. This bioacoustic approach offers a non- invasive, cost-effective, and timely early warning system for natural disasters. It combines ecological monitoring with disaster management and has the potential to improve preparedness and reduce the impact of disasters. The results demonstrate that the CNN model outperforms others in accuracy and reliability for real-time predictions. Future work aims to enhance the system by integrating IoT sensors for continuous monitoring and incorporating additional environmental factors such as seismic and meteorological data. This research highlights the potential of bioacoustic data in disaster prediction and provides a framework for further applications in ecological conservation and disaster management.
